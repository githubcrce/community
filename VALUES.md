# GitHubCRCE Community Values

GitHubCRCE Community culture contributes substantially to the community's success. The following values have evolved over time, pushing our community and peers toward constant improvement.

## Distribution is better than centralization

The scale of the GitHubCRCE Community is only viable through high-trust and high-visibility distribution of work, which includes delegation of authority, decision making, technical design, code ownership, and documentation. Distributed asynchronous ownership, collaboration, communication and decision making are the cornerstones of our world-wide community.

## Inclusive is better than exclusive

Broadly successful and useful technologies require different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be heard in a welcoming and respectful environment. Community membership is a privilege, not a right. Community members earn leadership through effort, scope, quality, quantity, and duration of contributions. Our community respects the time and effort put into a discussion, regardless of where a contributor is on their growth path.
